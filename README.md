## Featured Projects

### **[Document Intelligence SaaS Platform](https://github.com/ikramnaser/mySaaS)**
**Python, FastAPI, SpaCy, Tesseract OCR, Google Cloud Run**
- Developed a full-stack application for automated document processing. The system extracts text from PDFs and images, classifies documents by type, and identifies named entities using an NLP pipeline.structured data extraction from unstructured documents

### **[NLP for Low-Resource Language Machine Translation](https://github.com/ikramnaser/NLP-darija)**
**Python, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers**
- Researched and implemented NLP techniques for Darija (Moroccan Arabic), a low-resource language. The project involved data collection, cleaning, and experimenting with sequence-to-sequence models for dialectal translation.

### **[Cloud-Deployed Predictive Healthcare API](https://github.com/ikramnaser/Deploy-ML-Models-on-Google-Cloud-Platform)**
**Python, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- Deployed a machine learning model to predict heart attack risk based on patient clinical data. The end-to-end project includes data analysis, model training, and API development.

### **[Deep Learning for Image Classification](https://github.com/ikramnaser/Data-Science/tree/main/deep%20learning)**
**Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- Designed and trained a deep neural network to classify books by their cover art. The project involved advanced image preprocessing, augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning to improve model generalization.

### **[Web Data Extraction and Fact-Checking] (https://github.com/ikramnaser/web-data-processing)**
**Python, LLaMA2, BERT, Hugging Face, Wikidata API, llama.cpp**
- Created a robust system with LLaMA2 7B model for answer generation to natural language questions and automatically verifying their factual accuracy, developed a entity linking system to disambiguate and connect extracted entities to their corresponding pages in Wikipedia and Wikidata, forming an evidence base for validation.


### **[Algorithm Implementation: Decision Tree from Scratch](https://github.com/ikramnaser/Data-Science/tree/main/machine%20learning)**
**Python, NumPy, Algorithms**
- Implemented a decision tree classifier from the ground up without relying on libraries like scikit-learn. This involved coding the entropy calculation, information gain, and recursive splitting algorithms.

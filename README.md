**Tech:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, yfinance, SciPy  
**Summary:** Analyzed 5 years of stock data for 500 companies, visualized correlations & returns, and built portfolio optimization models using Monte Carlo simulations and Sharpe ratio maximization.

---

### NLP for Low-Resource Language Machine Translation
[View Project](https://github.com/ikramnaser/NLP-darija)  
**Tech:** Python, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, LLMs  
**Summary:** Implemented NLP techniques for Darija (Moroccan Arabic), including data collection, cleaning, and sequence-to-sequence translation models.

### Cloud-Deployed Predictive Healthcare API
[View Project](https://github.com/ikramnaser/Deploy-ML-Models-on-Google-Cloud-Platform)  
**Tech:** Python, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)  
**Summary:** Deployed a ML model to predict heart attack risk from clinical data. Includes end-to-end pipeline: data analysis, model training, and API deployment.

---

### Deep Learning for Image Classification
[View Project](https://github.com/ikramnaser/Data-Science/tree/main/deep%20learning%20for%20computer%20vision)  
**Tech:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, CNN  
**Summary:** Trained a deep neural network to classify book covers, using advanced preprocessing, augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning for better generalization.

---

### Web Data Extraction and Fact-Checking
[View Project](https://github.com/ikramnaser/web-data-processing)  
**Tech:** Python, LLaMA2, BERT, Hugging Face, Wikidata API, llama.cpp  
**Summary:** Built a system using LLaMA2 to answer questions and verify facts. Includes entity linking to Wikipedia/Wikidata for evidence-based validation.

---

### Algorithm Implementation: Decision Tree from Scratch
[View Project](https://github.com/ikramnaser/Data-Science/tree/main/machine%20learning)  
**Tech:** Python, NumPy, Algorithms  
**Summary:** Implemented a decision tree classifier from scratch, including entropy calculation, information gain, and recursive splitting.
